MultiCDR FDW
===================

Foreign Data Wrapper for dealing with multiple CDR files.
CDR files from a directory can be read into a table with a 
specified field-to-column mapping.

Usage
-------------------

Please refer to a PostgreSQL Foreign Data Wrapper documentation.
In a few words extension, foreign data server and foreign table
must be created with a superuser permission. Then a user with 
appropriate permissions can select CDR data from a table.

CDR file consists of multiple rows. Each row contains data fields at
fixed positions. List of positions is specified when table is created.
Some special rows are ignored if they contains not enough columns.

Now only integer (int32) and text column types are allowed. 
Please check fields for overflow.

Options
-------------------

* directory. Text, mandatory.
A directory where FDW should look for files. Scan is not recursive.

* pattern. Text, mandatory.
Posix Extended regex for selecting a file path.

* mapfields. Text array with a comma-separated integers, optional.
Specifies a mapping from table columns to a CDR fields. For example, "4,5,6"
says that fourth, fifth and sixth fields from each CDR row will be read to a
table. An array and a table must have equal dimensions.
Fields are mapped sequentially if mapfields is not specified.

* posfields. Text array with a comma-separated integers, mandatory.
Specified positions in chars where each CDR field is started. Fields are
always left-aligned so a position should point to the non-space.

* filefield. Text, optional.
Name of the column that should contain a row's file path.

Building
-------------------

1. Install a postgres 9.1 or newer
2. Build an extension
		make PG_CONFIG=/usr/local/postgre91/bin/pg_config clean all install
3. Restart a server
4. Create extension, foreign server and table

Example initialization sql script
-------------------

-- Should be run by a superuser

CREATE EXTENSION multicdr_fdw;

DROP FOREIGN TABLE IF EXISTS multicdr_test_table;
DROP SERVER IF EXISTS multicdr_fdw_server;

CREATE SERVER multicdr_fdw_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER multicdr_fdw;

CREATE FOREIGN TABLE multicdr_test_table (
    field1 text,
    field2 text,
    field3 text,
    field4 text,
    field5 text,
) SERVER multicdr_fdw_server OPTIONS (
	directory '/opt/pool',
	pattern '.*\.cdr',
	mapfields '3,4,5,0,1',
	posfields '0,6,15,40,50,71,92');
